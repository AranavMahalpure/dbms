Consider Following Schema
Employee (Employee_id, First_name, last_name , hire_date, salary, Job_title, manager_id, department_id)
Departments(Department_id, Department_name, Manager_id, Location_id)
Locations(location_id ,street_address ,postal_code, city, state, country_id)
Manager(Manager_id, Manager_name)
Create the tables with referential integrity. Solve following queries using joins and subqueries.
1. Write a query to find the names (first_name, last_name) and the salaries of the employees who have a
higher salary than the employee whose last_name=''Singh”.
2. Write a query to find the names (first_name, last_name) of the employees who have a manager and
work for a department based in the United States.
2. Write a query to find the names (first_name, last_name), the salary of the employees whose salary is
greater than the average salary.
3. Write a query to find the employee id, name (last_name) along with their manager_id, manager name
(last_name).
4. Find the names and hire date of the employees who were hired after 'Jones'.

SELECT E1.First_name, E1.Last_name, E1.Salary
FROM Employee E1
WHERE E1.Salary > (
    SELECT E2.Salary
    FROM Employee E2
    WHERE E2.Last_name = 'Singh'
);

SELECT E.First_name, E.Last_name
FROM Employee E
JOIN Departments D ON E.Department_id = D.Department_id
JOIN Locations L ON D.Location_id = L.Location_id
WHERE L.Country_id = 'US'
AND E.Manager_id IS NOT NULL;

SELECT E.First_name, E.Last_name, E.Salary
FROM Employee E
WHERE E.Salary > (
    SELECT AVG(Salary) 
    FROM Employee
);

SELECT E.Employee_id, E.Last_name, M.Manager_name
FROM Employee E
JOIN Manager M ON E.Manager_id = M.Manager_id
WHERE E.Hire_date > (
    SELECT E1.Hire_date
    FROM Employee E1
    WHERE E1.Last_name = 'Jones'
);

SELECT E.Employee_id, E.Last_name, E.Manager_id, M.Manager_name
FROM Employee E
JOIN Manager M ON E.Manager_id = M.Manager_id;
