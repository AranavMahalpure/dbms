Create following tables using a given schema and insert appropriate data into the same:
Customer (CustID, Name, Cust_Address, Phone_no, Email_ID, Age)
Branch (Branch ID, Branch_Name, Address)
Account (Account_no, Branch ID, CustID, date_open, Account_type, Balance)
1. Create the tables with referential integrity.
2. Draw the ER diagram for the same.
3. Create an Index on primary key column of table Account
4. Create the view as Customer_Info displaying the customer details for age less than 45.
5. Update the View with open date as 16/4/2017
6. Create a sequence on Branch able.
7. Create synonym ‘Branch_info’ for branch table.
